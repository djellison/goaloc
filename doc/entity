a goaloc entity needs to be able to encapsulate roughly what a merb slice does:  the model, view, and controller parts of an application.

it needs:

model:
associations
dbfields
validations
model_lifecycle_callbacks:  before_save, after_validate, etc..

controller:
list of actions to support
filters
destinations for the non-GET actions (delete, create, update ) (pretty much only 2 reasonable options for each)

view:
form, large and small individual representations, collection representation, optionally a layout

tests:
unit
functional
a coverage metric (how hard do you want this covered?)


An app has a collection of such entities, and also 
routes
plugins
gems
configuration


how does this play with javascript?  maybe better than rails.
how does this do continuation-based apps?
