= goaloc

* FIX (url)

== DESCRIPTION:

This is Generate on a Lot of Crack, which started its life as a more powerful script/generate for rails, and may evolve into a multi-framework webapp scaffolder

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

-currently supports only rails and some merb
it should:
-be easier to remove, rename, etc., attributes.
-support using a rails app specifier 
-be better tested internally
-support acts-as-tree things
-have high-level datatypes, like email, url, ssn, etc..
-handle singular resources
-handle enums, so you can do some of the constraint stuff from PicoLisp
-do haml for views (maybe?)
-generate tests for the generated app
-make nice semantic HTML for the views
-make it serve goaloc directly (this is maybe really hard)

==DONE:
-include jquery for js
-include bluetrip css framework

== SYNOPSIS:

Goaloc was motivated by the fact that to make a nested resource (ie, to get  /posts/1/comments to resolve), one must specify the relation between post and comment in 4 places:  the routes, the migration, and in both models.  That's silly, and not so DRY.  Enter GoaLoC, and the "blog in 15 minutes" talk essentially reduces to:

goaloc
>> @app.name = "myblog"
>> route [:posts, :comments]
>> add_attrs :posts => "body:text title:string", :comments => "body:text"
>> generate

generate presently only knows how to make rails apps, and part of merb apps, but in principle, any REST-centric MVC app could be targeted comfortably, and even PHP apps could be done.

route [:causes, { :class => :users, :through => :memberships }, :tasks, ]

will set up causes has many users through memberships

== REQUIREMENTS:

shoulda to run tests, possibly ruby2ruby in the future.

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install -s http://gems.github.com mattknox-goaloc
